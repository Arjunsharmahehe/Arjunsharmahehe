# Hi, I'm Arjun Sharma 👋

B.Tech IT student at GGSIPU (Batch of 2028)  
Passionate about building modern, user-centric web applications.

I’m deeply into web development and love turning ideas into working products. I enjoy building end-to-end apps, experimenting with UI/UX, and exploring system design fundamentals. I also dabble in Python and CS concepts (like data structures and probabilistic structures).
